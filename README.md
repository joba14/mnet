## Overview
The Mnet project is an off-grid communication project that establishes a mesh network using LoRa modules and STM32 boards. The implementation spans the first four layers of the OSI networking model, providing features like virtual addressing, self-routing, and efficient packet handling.

## Features
- **LoRa Communication:** Long-range, low-power wireless communication.
- **Virtual Addressing:** Nodes are identified using virtual addresses, similar to IP addresses.
- **Self-Routing:** Nodes determine the optimal path for packet transmission.
- **Packet Handling:** Efficient packet construction, defragmentation, and reconstruction.

## Hardware Requirements
- STM32 (Bluepill) Development Boards
- LoRa Modules (compatible with STM32)
- Additional hardware as needed (sensors, power supply, etc.)
